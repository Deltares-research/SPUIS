SPUIS is a 1D model for calculating flows in discharge sluices. See the [documentation](https://spuis.readthedocs.io/) for more details and theory.

### *Required Python packages* <br/>
To install the required packages, run the following command in the command window:
<pre>
pip install -r ./docs/requirements.txt
</pre>

### *Running a simulation* <br/>
Run 'runSpuis.py' (./SPUIS) to execute a simulation and postprocess the results. The input files have the extension ".in". Some example input files can be found in the folder "Tests". The output files (.uqh and .uws) and generated figures will be saved to the folder in which the corresponding input file was saved.
