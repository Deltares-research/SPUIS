Example: Bathse Spuisluis
===========

This example demonstrates the capabilities of SPUIS4.01 by applying it to a real-world discharge sluice that is part of the Dutch Deltaworks: discharge sluice Bath (Dutch: ‘Bathse Spuisluis’). This discharge sluice is located at the end of a flushing channel (Dutch: ‘Bathse Spuikanaal’) between Lake Volkerak-Zoom and the Western Scheldt. It discharges surplus fresh water from the lake into the Western Scheldt to regulate Lake Volkerak-Zoom’s water level and to improve its water quality. The discharge sluice consists of six concrete culverts and has a maximum discharge capacity of 300,000 litres per second. A zigzag shaped energy dissipator is located at the end of the outflow channel. A schematic top view of discharge sluice Bath is shown below.

The result of schematizing discharge sluice Bath in SPUIS4.01 are shown below together with field measurements from 1988 and calibrated calculations used by Rijkswaterstaat (Directorate-General of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of the Netherlands) in their operational water management. The configuration of each culvert during the measurements is denoted by “O” for fully opened and “X” for closed.
